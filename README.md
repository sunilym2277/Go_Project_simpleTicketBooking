# **Go Project: Simple Ticket Booking**
A command-line interface (CLI) application for booking tickets, created to demonstrate the fundamentals of the Go programming language.



## **Description**
This project is a simple, beginner-friendly ticket booking system implemented in Go. It allows users to book tickets for an event, demonstrating basic Go concepts such as variables, functions, user input, and control flow. The main goal of this project is to provide a practical example for those who are new to Go and want to see a simple application in action.


### Includes fundamentles of Go :
variables
loops
functions
conditions
scope
Arrays
slices
maps
pointers
Error handling
Go routines


## Features
Book tickets: Allows users to enter their name, and email and book a number of tickets for an event.
User input validation: Basic validation to ensure that the user enters valid information.
Concurrency: (Assumed, based on typical Go learning projects) May demonstrate the use of Goroutines to handle multiple bookings concurrently.
